# E-Learning for Frontend

The following E-learning is recommended for you to watch through during the frontend part of the course. Of course, not everything is needed, there is a lot in there but I will try and specify the most important parts of each part.

## JavaScript

Path - [**JavaScript 2022**](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/javascript-2022)

This is a path that contains over 60 hours of material. What you should focus on is the following:

1. [**Building a JavaScript Development Environment**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-building-development-environment/table-of-contents) _( Optional )_
  
    If you need more help with installing and setting up the Visual Studio Code enviroment and node.
  
2. [**Javascript Fundamentals**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fundamentals-javascript/table-of-contents) _( As needed, depending on your previous knowledge )_

    Contains everything you need to get started and we will use a lot of it during the frontend part of your LTU journey. You will find great content in each and every module of this fundamentals course.

3. [**Debugging JavaScript Applications**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-debugging-applications/table-of-contents) _( Good stuff! )_

    Debugging is always hard but you have learned a lot about it in the C# part of the LTU course. In this smaller course, you have two recommended modules.
      
      - _Debugging Frontend JS with Chrome DevTools_
      - _Finding Common bugs_

## React

Path - [**React 18**](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/react-18)

This path covers more than 80 hours of material which is too much for us, but these links below are some that I recommened. 

1. [**React Fundamentals**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-18-fundamentals/table-of-contents)

    All modules in this course have values except the module about server-side React and Next.js. That is something we are not going to cover.

2. In the Core React section, there are four courses that might be of value to you if you feel the need for it, but I am not going to enforce them really, since we might cover them briefly during the lectures. They are:

      - [Working with Components in React 18](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-18-working-components/table-of-contents)
      - [Using Hooks in React 18](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-18-using-hooks/table-of-contents)
      - [Managing State in Reat 18](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-18-managing-state/table-of-contents)
      - [Working with Data in React](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-working-data/table-of-contents)
